# Resource: Shared ncRNA-mRNA ASE events
To interactively access the resource generated by *Hasenbein T. et al.*, please click on the following links for the tissue of interest.
Candidate predictions will be displayed via the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV)[^1]. Moreover, JSON files can be downloaded from the resource folder and loaded as *Session* from within the [IGV browser](https://igv.org/app/). Description of the individual tracks can be found in the example sections for mice and human.

| Track      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Allelome.LINK_Ki_9w_enhancing| Green arcs show enhancing linkages, where a ncRNA was predicted to have an enhancing function on the linked protein-coding target gene. By clicking on the linkage, both interaction loci are named, and the linkage score is displayed |
| Merged_fwd | RNA-seq track as a representative example. The track was obtained from a single replicate out of the three replicates where the linkages are based on. Reads are shown for the forward strand only and split towards the maternal (red) and paternal (blue) allele |
| Allelome.PRO_Ki_9w | Allelome.PRO v2.0 output naming the locus, the median number of reads, the min. allelic score and the median allelic ratio. The color denotes the allelic bias (red: maternal, green: biallelic, blue: paternal)|
| Refseq Genes | RefSeq gene annotation |
| Merged_rev | RNA-seq track as a representative example. The track was obtained from a single replicate out of the three replicates where the linkages are based on. Reads are shown for the reverse strand only and split towards the maternal (red) and paternal (blue) allele |
| Allelome.LINK_Ki_9w_repressive| Red arcs show repressive linkages, where a ncRNA was predicted to have a repressive function on the linked protein-coding target gene. By clicking on the linkage, both interaction loci are named, and the linkage score is displayed  |

### 5.2 Example: Cells- Cultured Fibroblast
<img width="700" alt="mice_example" src="https://github.com/AndergassenLab/Allelome.LINK/assets/146940261/cf728db9-3bbd-46ef-99a1-9dbce639c9a2"><br />

| Track      | Description   |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| Cells-Cultured-fibroblasts_enh| Green arcs show enhancing linkages, where a ncRNA was predicted to have an enhancing function on the linked protein-coding target gene. By clicking a linkage, both interaction loci are named, along with the linkage score and the GTEx sample where the linkage was found. Different arcs represent different samples. |
| RNAseq.bw | RNA-seq track as a representative example. The track was obtained from a single sample of the tissue on which the linkages are based on.|
| annotation.bed | GENCODE v26 GRCh38 annotation |
| Cells-Cultured-fibroblasts_rep| Red arcs show repressive linkages, where a ncRNA was predicted to have a repressive function on the linked protein-coding target gene. By clicking on the linkage, both interaction loci are named, along with the linkage score and the GTEx sample where the linkage was found. Different arcs represent different sample.  |
| gwas_snps.bed | GWAS SNPs derived from the Ebi GWAS catalog |
